# Adjective

Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns or pronouns. They provide additional information about the noun or pronoun, such as its size, color, shape, or state of being. Here are some examples of adjectives:

- The red car
- A large pizza
- An old book
- The happy child
- A beautiful flower

In each of these examples, the adjective provides **additional information** about the noun it is modifying. "Red" describes the color of the car, "large" describes the size of the pizza, "old" describes the age of the book, "happy" describes the emotional state of the child, and "beautiful" describes the appearance of the flower.

Here are some examples of how adjectives can be used before a noun and with verbs:

1. Adjectives before a noun:
   - "The blue sky" (describes the color of the sky)
   - "A delicious meal" (describes the quality of the meal)
   - "A big house" (describes the size of the house)

2. Adjectives with verbs:
   - "She looked happy" (describes the **emotional state** of the subject)
   - "He sounded excited" (describes the **tone** of the subject's voice)
   - "They felt tired" (describes the **physical state** of the subject)

In the first set of examples, the adjectives come before the noun they are modifying and provide additional information about it. In the second set of examples, the adjectives come after a **linking verb** (such as "looked," "sounded," or "felt") and describe the subject of the sentence.

Using adjectives in these ways can help to provide more detail and description in your writing or speech. Just remember to use the appropriate adjective form depending on the noun it is modifying (e.g. singular or plural) and to use the correct verb tense with the adjective.

Remember that adjectives are used to provide more information about nouns or pronouns, and they can help make your writing more descriptive and interesting!
