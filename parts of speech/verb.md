# Verb

A verb is a word that describes an **action**, **occurrence**, or **state of being**. Verbs are often called "**doing words**" because they show an action that is being done, such as "run," "swim," or "write."

Here are some examples of verbs:

- "She ran to catch the bus."
- "He is swimming in the pool."
- "They wrote a letter to their friend."

In each of these examples, the verb describes the action that is taking place. "Ran" describes the action of running, "is swimming" describes the current state of swimming, and "wrote" describes the action of writing.

Verbs can also be used in different tenses to indicate when the action is taking place. For example:

- Present tense: "I walk to school every day."
- Past tense: "I walked to school yesterday."
- Future tense: "I will walk to school tomorrow."

Verbs can also be used in different forms, such as the infinitive form (e.g. "to walk"), the gerund form (e.g. "walking"), or the participle form (e.g. "walked").

In addition to describing actions, verbs can also describe states of being, such as "**is**," "**am**," or "**are**." These are called **linking verbs**, and they connect the subject of the sentence to additional information, such as a predicate noun or adjective.

Overall, verbs are a crucial part of any sentence, as they provide the action or state of being that the sentence describes.
